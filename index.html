    Hi!

  -->
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>I'm a software engineer living in Portland, Maine.</p>
  <p>During my working hours I build internet things with the wonderful folks at
  <a href="https://www.ivantagehealth.com/">iVantage Health Analytics</a>.
  Only... I didn't work on that site. That's was our marketing team :). Most of
  my work sits behind a login page, but there are links to my open source stuff
  below.</p>
  <p>JavaScript, and the front-end in general, are particular passions of mine
  but I enjoy other development and computer sciencey stuff too. Actually, right
  now I'm working on a Master's degree at Georgia Tech with a specialization
  machine learning.</p>
  <p>Looking for more?</p>
