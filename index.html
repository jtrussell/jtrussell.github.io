          <h3>‚ú® GenAI Match Summaries</h3>
          <p>
            At Club Locker, we continuously seek new ways to engage users and make the
            most of our data. By analyzing match histories and telemetry from our
            real-time scoring app, we generate detailed and insightful match summaries
            for players.

          <h3>üöÄ Cost Center Coding with NLP</h3>
          <p>
            Cost benchmarking relies on standardizing spending categories. At
            iVantage, we applied natural language processing and document
            classification techniques to analyze general ledger line items and cost
            center descriptions, enabling accurate, apples-to-apples comparisons of
            hospital spending profiles.

          <h3>üåé Service Areas by Genetic Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Defining hospital service areas is crucial for market research, outreach,
            analysis, recruitment, and other initiatives. However, restrictions in
            certain applications can make these definitions challenging to manage at
            scale. At iVantage, we leveraged genetic algorithms to gain deeper
            insights into the hospital service area landscape across the United
            States. Read more about this use of GA
