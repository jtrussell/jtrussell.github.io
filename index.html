    <div role="doc-subtitle">
      Full Stack Software Engineer, Technology Leader

    <p>
      Justin resides minutes outside the city of Portland on the Southern Coast
      of Maine. He currently serves as Principal Engineer for
      <a href="https://www.ussquash.com/">US Squash</a> and
      <a href="https://about.clublocker.com/">Club Locker</a> and formerly as
      Vice President of Engineering at iVantage Health Analytics.

    <h2>Project Highlights</h2>

    <h3>✨ GenAI Match Summaries</h3>
    <p>
      At Club Locker, we continuously seek new ways to engage users and make the
      most of our data. By analyzing match histories and telemetry from our
      real-time scoring app, we generate detailed and insightful match summaries
      for players.
    </p>

    <h3>🚀 Cost Center Coding with NLP</h3>
    <p>
      Cost benchmarking relies on standardizing spending categories. At
      iVantage, we applied natural language processing and document
      classification techniques to analyze general ledger line items and cost
      center descriptions, enabling accurate, apples-to-apples comparisons of
      hospital spending profiles.
    </p>

    <h3>🌎 Genetic Algorithms Driven Service Areas</h3>
    <p>
      Defining hospital service areas is crucial for market research, outreach,
      analysis, recruitment, and other initiatives. However, restrictions in
      certain applications can make these definitions challenging to manage at
      scale. At iVantage, we leveraged genetic algorithms to gain deeper
      insights into the hospital service area landscape across the United
      States. Read more about this use of GA

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      Justin received his master's degree in Computer Science with a
      specialization in Machine Learning from The Georgia Institute of
      Technology and his Bachelor of Science from Colby College with a focus in
      Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics.

    <h2>Misc.</h2>
    <p>Here's a bunch of fun stuff I enjoy, feel free to ask for more!</p>

    <p>
      <strong>🎾 Squash</strong> - the racquet sport. I've played for many years
      and can be found regularly on court at Portland Community Squash.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🏃‍➡️ Running</strong> - I've completed five marathons and would
      like to do one more.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>🎲 Games</strong> - Primarily board and card games. I started
      playing <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in 1994 and am currently deep in the
      world of <em>KeyForge</em> where I co-host and produce
      <https://open.spotify.com/show/2P9gscRTrxfjWkGLB5tvtEa href="">a weekly
      podcast</a> focused on the design and strategy of the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>⛰️ Hiking</strong> - I've done some notable destination hikes,
      Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and the Inca Trail in Peru. Closer to home,
      I'm working my way through the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
