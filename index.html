    Oh, hello there.

    Might I interest you in a blog post or two?

  <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
  <p>I'm a software engineer and web developer living in Portland, Maine.</p>
  <p>During working hours I build internet things with the wonderful folks at <a
    href="http://www.ivantagehealth.com/">iVantage Health Analytics</a>.
  Only... I didn't work on that site. That's was our marketing team :). Most of
  my work sits behind a login page but there are links to our (and my) open
  source work below.</p>
  <p>JavaScript and front-end engineering are a particular passion of mine but I
  enjoy other development and computer sciencey stuff too. For example, how
  should one actually spell "front-end"? Dash? No dash? One word?...</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">In my free time</span> Instead
  of sleeping I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer science through the OMS
  CS program at Georgia Tech with a focus in AI and machine learning.</p>
  <p>Looking for more?</p>
