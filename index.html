  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>I'm a software engineer living in Portland, Maine.</p>
  <p>During my working hours I build internet things with the wonderful folks at
  <a href="https://www.ivantagehealth.com/">iVantage Health Analytics</a>.
  Most of my work sits behind a login page, but you can find links to some of my
  open source work below.</p>
  <p>JavaScript, and the front-end in general, are particular passions of mine,
  but I do enjoy other areas of development too. Actually, right now I'm working
  on a Master's degree at Georgia Tech with a specialization machine
  learning.</p>
  <p>Looking for more?</p>
